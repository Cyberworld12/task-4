     SUMMARY: HOW UFW FIREWALL FILTERS TRAFFIC

UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) acts as a user-friendly interface for iptables, making it easier to define rules.

   - Default Policy: Deny all incoming, allow outgoing

    Rule Example:

       - allow 22 → Opens SSH port

        -deny 23 → Blocks Telnet port

    -Inbound Rules: Protect against unwanted access

    -Outbound Rules (less commonly used): Restrict internal access to external services

Firewall rules help enforce the principle of least privilege by only allowing necessary traffic.
